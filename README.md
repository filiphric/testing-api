# Testing API with Cypress

Companion repo to my presentation on testing API with Cypress. It contains examples shown in presentation, as well as the app tested. To run this, clone this repo and type:

```
npm install
```
to your terminal. This will install all the dependenciesa and the application. Then, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

To open Cypress, open another terminal window without closing the previous one and type:
```
npx cypress open
```
